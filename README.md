# 🏡 Predicting House Prices using Linear Regression

This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict house prices in California based on various features like income, age, number of rooms, population, and location coordinates.

## 📘 About the Project

This is my first machine learning project built during the **Complete Machine Learning and Data Science Course** by **Priya Bhatia Ma’am** from **GeeksforGeeks**.

The main goal is to:
- Understand data preprocessing
- Build and train a regression model
- Evaluate model performance
- Learn how ML models make predictions

## 📊 Dataset Used
We used the **California Housing Dataset**, which contains housing data for California districts.  
Each record includes:
- Median income
- House age
- Average rooms & bedrooms
- Population
- Latitude & Longitude
- ...and the target: **Median house value**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
